## How setup and run project

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environement.

    $ node --version
    v14.15.4

    $ npm --version
    6.14.10

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/pesto-students/babitz-frontend.git
    $ cd babitz-frontend
    $ npm install
    
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
